Inform drivers of upcoming risks on the road with Arity’s Safe Alerts API. We’ve aggregated many data sources of vehicle collisions on the road and applied our predictive modelling expertise to predict areas with the highest risk to drivers.

Safe Alerts API exposes information about those highest risk locations so you can warn your drivers in the application. Data returned include location and geometry of the alert, type of alert (risk of rear-end accident, risk of side-swipe, etc.), the relative severity of the alert (high, medium, low), and a description.

Arity’s Safe Alerts informs drivers of upcoming risks on the road and provides context so they can take action to mitigate those risks.
